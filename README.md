This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze a transactional dataset of pharmaceutical products.
The primary goal is to discover hidden patterns and associations between different drugs purchased together
The analysis successfully identifies strong association rules, quantified by metrics like support, confidence, and lift.
Customers often purchase multiple items in a single transaction.
This analysis, known as market basket analysis (MBA), is a cornerstone of data-driven decision-making in retail.
